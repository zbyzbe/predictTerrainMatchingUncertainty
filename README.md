# predictTerrainMatchingUncertainty
In the geometry-based applications of ICESat-2 (ATLAS), the terrain matching, which registers the laser altimetry data with other sources of topographic data, conducts as a effective approach for accuracy verification or multiple data registration. We derive a theoretical uncertainty model linking performance with the main influence factors.
